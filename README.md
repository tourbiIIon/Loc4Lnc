## Introduction

**Loc4Lnc** is a deep learning framework specifically designed to predict the subcellular localization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using sequence-based features and advanced neural network architectures. Accurate prediction of lncRNA localization is critical for understanding their functional roles and potential involvement in disease mechanisms. The model supports classification into 5 subcellular compartments, including cytoplasm, nucleus, cytosol, exosome, and chromatin. 

This repository provides the **core codebase** for Loc4Lnc, covering essential components such as **data preprocessing**, **embedding extraction**, and **model training**. The repository also includes a detailed tutorial to help users understand how to prepare input data, extract relevant features, and train the Loc4Lnc model for subcellular localization prediction.
